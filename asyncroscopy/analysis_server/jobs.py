"""
Background analysis jobs behind the shared job envelope.

Stitching a large map takes minutes, longer than an MCP request should
block. Jobs therefore follow the same contract as asyncroscopy's instrument
jobs (``asyncroscopy/contracts/envelope.schema.json``):
reserve -> start -> status -> results -> release, with abort at any time.

Started jobs run on a bounded pool of worker threads (``max_workers``); a job
started while every worker is busy is ``queued`` until one is free.
