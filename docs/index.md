Welcome to the Asyncroscopy documentation site.
Use this site to navigate contributor guidance, microscope architecture notes, hardware extension docs, MCP server references, and upcoming changes.

## Start Here

- [Contributing Guide](dev_guide.md): project engineering principles and pull request expectations.
- [Base Electron Microscope Extension Notes](Microscopy/modify_base_electron_microscope.md): where to add or change core microscope behavior.
