Note: `main` branch now contains the PyTango-based architecture. The previous Twisted-based implementation is preserved in the `twisted-legacy` branch for reference.

## Requirements and Installation

### Core installation (simulation mode)

```bash
pip install .
```

or with `uv`:

```bash
uv sync
```

This installs `asyncroscopy` and all core dependencies. AutoScript is not required—the
framework will fall back to simulated acquisition automatically.

### Hardware installation (Thermo Fisher AutoScript)

By default, the project uses **stubs** (metadata-only wheels) in the `stubs/` directory to satisfy
dependency resolution. These stubs do **not** contain any proprietary code.

If you have access to the real proprietary AutoScript wheels, place them in a local directory
(e.g., `./hardware_wheels/`) and install them over the stubs:

```bash
uv pip install ./hardware_wheels/*.whl --force-reinstall
```

> [!WARNING]
> Never place your real wheels in the `stubs/` directory, as they would be tracked by Git.
> Always use a separate, ignored directory for real hardware files.

## Running tests

```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```
